# ✅ Validation Report: Experiment 1 (Smoke Test)

**Team:** UTOPIA
**Date:** 2025-11-17 (Post-Experiment 1 Analysis)
**Sprint Decision:** **PERSEVERE**

---

## 🎯 Core Hypothesis & Target

| Field | Description | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hypothesis** | KIU students feeling academic stress will **sign up for an anonymous support tool** because they currently fear judgment when venting on public social media. | `uploaded:hypothesis.md` |
| **Success Metric** | Achieve a **>15% Conversion Rate** (Signups / Unique Visitors). | `uploaded:experiment-plan.md` |
| **Riskiest Assumption** | Students will overcome their internal barrier (fear of judgment/stigma) to signal demand for the solution. | `uploaded:experiment-plan.md` |

## 📊 Results & Validation Status

The experiment successfully validated the demand for the proposed solution, exceeding the primary success threshold.

| Metric | Target Threshold | Actual Result | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Conversion Rate** | >15.0% | **16.9%** (28 Signups / 165 Visitors) | ✅ **VALIDATED** |
| **Signups (Total Volume)** | 50 | 28 | ❌ **MISSED** (Low traffic volume) |
| **Mobile Conversion Rate** | N/A (Observed Metric) | **~25.0%** | 🧠 **KEY INSIGHT** |

### Conclusion
The core problem assumption—that **academic stress is painful enough** and the promise of **anonymity is a strong enough motivator**—is **VALIDATED**. The conversion rate of **16.9%** (or 18.3% as noted in `uploaded:experiment-01-analysis.md`) demonstrates that a significant portion of the target audience is interested in the value proposition.

## 💡 Key Learnings & Next Steps

### Learnings
1.  **Anonymity is the Key Value Prop:** Qualitative feedback repeatedly highlighted **privacy concerns** ("Will the university see my data?") and validated that **anonymity is the main selling point**.
2.  **Mobile-First Approach Confirmed:** The **25% mobile conversion rate** (vs. 10% desktop) confirms the need for a **mobile-optimized product** (PWA/responsive web), as noted in the `uploaded:updated-roadmap.md`.
3.  **Persevere, But Improve Acquisition:** The low total signup volume means acquisition channels need improvement, but the high conversion rate justifies proceeding with development.

### Decision Framework (Next Steps)
Based on the `uploaded:pivot-decision-001.md` and the overall results:

| Outcome | Action | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hypothesis VALIDATED** | **PERSEVERE** → Proceed to build the MVP. | Demand is proven; the value proposition resonates strongly. |

### Immediate Actions (Focus of Next Sprint)
1.  **Run Experiment 2:** Begin testing the **value of peer-driven content** (Wizard of Oz / Manual Support) to confirm the solution's efficacy, as outlined in the `uploaded:experiment-plan.md`.
2.  **MVP Development:** Begin **Sprint 1** development with a focus on a **Mobile-first Frontend** for the check-in/support tool, prioritizing the 'read-only' view of peer reflections.
3.  **User Interviews:** Interview the 28 people who signed up to gather specific qualitative feature requests before coding.
